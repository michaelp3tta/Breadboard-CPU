<h1>Breadboard CPU</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a breadboard-based 8-bit CPU built entirely from basic logic chips and discrete components. The system is designed to demonstrate the fundamental building blocks of computer architecture, including registers, an ALU, program counter, control logic, and RAM. Instructions are executed through a simple instruction set, with clock pulses (LM555) driving the flow of data across the bus. The project is currently in progress, with the RAM module currently being built and tested, tested, the goal is to create a fully functioning CPU.
